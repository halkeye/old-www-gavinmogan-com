# Renewed Interest in Dating

[Modern Flirting (washingtonpost.com)](http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A32799-2003Oct15)

Gick recently acquired an etiquette book from her parents and shared it with her friends, chuckling over its clear conventions about dating: "Can you imagine a guy coming up and saying, 'How's the weather? And would you like to go to the spring dance?' "

Romantic flirting, like social flirting, "makes other people feel good about themselves and about you," she continued. "It acts as kindling in a relationship, producing a slow, sure, hot fire. When you cut to the chase instead, there's not much of a fire."

I'm not entirely sure why, but I really like thie article. I guess its the way I grew up, the way I was lead to belive by tv and such (not that I had any other examples, but still). But once I got there, I found relationships and people nothing like TV told me it would be. This article so helped to explain so mucha bout life. I have to admit, I really like reading ['Just a Gwai Lo'](http://www.justagwailo.com/), not only is he an awsome writer, but I get to find out so many interesting things about life and such. Its defanatly a good article. People should defanatly read it.
