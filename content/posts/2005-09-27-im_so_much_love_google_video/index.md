I've been searching around alot with google video. Its amazing all the videos out there.

For Example:

[the old LARPers now with special effects](https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1775035533657057275&q=lightsaber)  

[Young lightsaber duelests who did this well coreographed video (although the wordage sucks)](https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=106590075339710943&q=lightsaber)

Eveything from trailers, to home videos, to even full blown tv shows seem to be on here. Even looking up [Mike's Slurrey](https://www.slurrey.com) shows up alot of stuff, including a few of my party videos.
