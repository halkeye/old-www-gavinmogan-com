I've fallen in love with [tidy-proxy](https://tidy-proxy.freesources.org/). Its a simple little program that sits in front of you and the internet, and checks every incoming site for valid html and such..

It so cool. I found out that [j0rd's](https://j0rd.ath.cx) website is non standard... This coming from the guy who constantly complains about how other sites are not actually up to spec.

Yea, its really only cool for anal web developpers and such. But I figured it was time for an update anyways, and this felt like a good enough one.
