YEa, other than the website, i don't have much to say, it is REALLY fun...

Just [Download](https://web.archive.org/web/20180307003844/https://mtavc.com/) the client, install, and you are ready to go..

Its still very buggy, we get random crashes, lots of lag, but it would rock for a land party...
