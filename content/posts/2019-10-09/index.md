This is my first post since setting up netlifycms, which is also why I haven't posted in a while, since it was harder than i wanted to add new content. So :fingerscrossed: 🤞

So onto the purpose of this post.

Last week I started to prep for an upcoming table top adventure over the weekend. I was expecting to use my normal M&Ms to mark killable NPCs (cause people can eat thier souls upon death), from a stat keeping perspective, I was pretty limited to 5 items, or having to use something other than color.

So started to look around at tokens. I did manage to find a set on thingiverse, but they didn't quite meet my needs. 

My buddy [wetfly](https://wetfly.artstation.com/store/MeK3/3d-printable-generic-tokens-for-rpgs-labelled-0-9) has started an adventure down the path of learning blender and I was pretty certain we could take blender files, and convert them to 3D print STL files. And wow did he come through. I mean they are super simple, but they worked so well (seen above). He has the stl files available in his [artstation store](https://wetfly.artstation.com/store/MeK3/3d-printable-generic-tokens-for-rpgs-labelled-0-9).

I'm really happy with the outcome of these tokens. They fit well within the grid, the raised numbers make it super easy to do a different color, and thus super easy to see.

We debated about if 6 and 9 will be hard to tell the difference, so he made some with underlines. They certainly work, but I think I prefer the non underlined versions for now.
