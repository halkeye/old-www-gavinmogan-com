After a couple of emails about MTLJPost and working with MT for [HiSciFi](http://www.hiscifi.com), I think I might go back to using MT.

That way I can work on MTLJPost again neatly.

If it wasn't so late, I'd also, I'd also talk about my experiences with Postfix+mysql+sasl+imap and the 3 week fun it took to get it all working nice and cleanly. But its late, I'm tired, so I'll just say Wh00t, linux does rock, 'cause i was able to hack an open source pam module to get things working the way i wanted.

I proved to myself I could write a CMS, and I did, now i'm thinking i'll go back to the hardened MT.
