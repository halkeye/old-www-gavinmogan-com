So this year my mom decided I should have a KitchenAid Mix Master for christmas. So far I'm loving it.

Last weekend I totally experimented by making my first ever batch of meatballs. So [Nigel](https://www.forgreatjustice.ca/) and I go off to the store to figure out what we can find. We end up wanting a mixture of meats, so we go with ground turkey and ground sirloin beef.

# Meatballs

**From:** https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/anne-burrell/excellent-meatballs-recipe.html

**CookTime:** 25 min

**Yields:** 10

## Ingredients

*   1 Large Onion Diced
*   Extra-virgin olive oil
*   2 cloves garlic
*   crushed red pepper
*   0.5kg of ground beef and ground turkey
*   2 large eggs
*   Lots of ground cheese (I used soy loaf cheese cause lactose intollerant)
*   1 cup breadcrumbs
*   1/2 cup water

## Directions

1) Cooked onions in a frying pan. When mostly clear, add garlic and some crushed red pepper.
2) In a large bowl, add Meat, Eggs, Cheese, Breadcrumbs, Onions and start the mixer.
3) At this point I got crazy and added some dill and a couple other spices. They weren't really noticeable though.
4) Brown meatball creations using oil and pan, then bake on a baking sheet at 350F for about 25 minutes depending on size of the meatball.
