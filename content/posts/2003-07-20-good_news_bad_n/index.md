We Get to play another game of good news bad news tonight.

**Bad News**
On one of the hottest days as of lately, my fan dies, so now my room is completely air circulation proof :( I'll have to bug mom to get me a new fan, or goto dads more, or even move there.

**Awesomely good news**
I got asked today if i knew any programmers who were wanting to get involved in a project using a commercial engine... So I'm now going to probably be working on a game that uses the bioware engine (I believe the neverwinter nights one), which is cool, i just gotta find some other interested people, i think I'm going to ask Jordan and Richard, the only real issue is that since bioware doesn't want it leaving the office, we have to work there instead.

So i got another game to work on, this one, and the program with [![userinfo](https://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif)kanis](https://www.livejournal.com/users/kanis/), so I'll be quite busy for a while.. YAY!
i like being busy, makes me less depressed, but i still need to become more social.
