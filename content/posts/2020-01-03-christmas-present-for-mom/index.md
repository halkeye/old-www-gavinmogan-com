So things started with this random [post on /r/3dprinting](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/e4mbax/my_first_self_designed_useful_printnot_much_and_i/) where I saw this really cool diorama. I, as most people do in that sub, asked OP if they were up for sharing the designs.

I got really excited cause I think it could make a fun simple gift. The Prusa MK3s was big enough to do the parts in 2 batches. 

First was just the trees

Next was the animals and the base. The base I actually ended up re-printing after deciding to do a led strip on the bottom (I'll be posting a remix asap).

Picked up a simple LED strip from the electronics stored, and a bunch of [barrel plugs](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07M84YCYG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1), and [12V 1A plugs](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07M84YCYG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1), and as such, got an excuse to do a bit of soldering which I don't often get to do, and even got to use the heat shrink wrap which I've never used before.

The final soldering looks pretty good. Was able to get the led strip in nicely, a bunch of hot glue later

Ended up with this super nice gift for my mom.
