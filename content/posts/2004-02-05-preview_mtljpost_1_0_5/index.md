Doing a configuration interface. It looks kinda cool.

At least until the Plugin Manager's config interface is done. Although this still might be better.

Error message now actually work. I can't belive I never actually tested that, so the old messages would be really confusing.

I can't say the html is currently any good. But for now, it works.

If i can figure out how to store it (still havn't looked into it, probably use MT::PluginData again), I could even let you do multiple servers. Although I think it would probably delay posting time way to long.

I think this method might be the best.

Yea. Now to decide weither to goto sleep or finish this up sorta..
